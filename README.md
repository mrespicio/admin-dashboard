# Project Goals
Put together an admin dashboard using CSS grid

# The Plan
This project challenges me focus on the page layout to create a successful admin dashboard design. I will first break up the page into the biggest sections to create the overall layout using grid. I will then be able to focus on each individual section one at a time to ensure responsiveness.
